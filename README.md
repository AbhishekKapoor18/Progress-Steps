This project showcases a Progress Bar.

The purpose of this project might not seem useful but a progress bar like this can be used in an e-commerce payments page or a forms page, the options are endless when you come to think of it.

It's another one of the projects that I'm doing to sharpen my HTML,CSS And JavaScript Skills.
